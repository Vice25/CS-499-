Lastly, including my proficiency in MySQL in my portfolio also reflects my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth. Relational databases are constantly evolving, and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements and best practices is essential. 

 Enhancing the Artifact requires a secure environment in which to work. The environment provided when a MySQL download is installed and configured accommodates these conditions from the very beginning. Allowing the user to set a password for the root, act as administrator, and assign permission to users is a way MySQL allows security measures to be set. The screenshots in the Artifact Three enhancement show how to enable the authentication plugin so no unauthorized access will be permitted. The use of the newer feature, “caching_sha2_password” greatly ensures a safe and workable environment reducing the threat of cyber-attacks and hackers. MySQL has a built-in feature called “at rest encryption” that ensures the data is encrypted and protected from attacks. The recreation of the database schema “QuantigrationUpdates” with its three tables, “Customers, Orders, and RMA” was provided to demonstrate my ability to recreate the same dataset in a different environment. The examples provided of the CRUD functions, Create, Read, Update, and Delete show my ability to manage data in the way that all big data are used just on a larger scale.
