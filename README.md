## Self Assessment



  
Over the course of my educational journey towards earning a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, which began in January 2020, I have actively worked to develop a wide range of skills and competencies in various aspects of computer science. My concentration is Data Analytics. I am looking to work in this field; I am particularly interested in the areas of data cleaning and data mining. Both were subjects I was able to work on while pursuing this concentration. 

 Completing my coursework and developing this ePortfolio has been an invaluable journey that has not only allowed me to showcase my strengths but has also significantly shaped my professional goals and values. Throughout the program, I have acquired a diverse set of skills and competencies that have prepared me to enter and excel in the computer science field. In this self-assessment, I will discuss how my coursework and ePortfolio have contributed to my readiness for employment in the computer science field, with a focus on collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering, database management, and security.

**Collaborating in a Team Environment:**
         Throughout my program, I have actively engaged in collaborative projects and coursework that have honed my ability to work effectively in team environments. In various group projects, I have taken on roles that required leadership, coordination, and collaboration with team members. One notable example is in the course material for my Software Development Lifecycle, we had different scenarios and role-playing to simulate Agile meetings.

**Communicating to Stakeholders:**
         Effective communication with stakeholders is a fundamental skill in computer science. During my coursework, I have worked on assignments that required me to prepare technical reports, documentation, and presentations that effectively communicate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. An example outside of the artifacts in my ePortfolio is my course on Data cleaning in which I had to put together a presentation for a non-technical audience.

**Data Structures and Algorithms:**
         My coursework has equipped me with a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms, which are fundamental to computer science. I have successfully completed projects that involved implementing various data structures and algorithms, such as linked lists, binary search trees, and sorting algorithms. One example is a project where I implemented a bid management program, showcasing my ability to work with data structures, object-oriented programming, and algorithmic principles.

**Software Engineering and Database Management:**
         In my program, I have delved into software engineering practices, including software design, development, and testing. I have developed professional-grade software solutions, such as enhancing a bid management program by introducing a bidirectional selection sort algorithm. Additionally, I have gained proficiency in database management, including SQL, relational database design, and data manipulation. Beyond my ePortfolio artifacts, I have created databases and written SQL queries for various projects, demonstrating my ability to design and manage databases effectively.

**Security:**
         Security has been a central focus of my program, and I have developed a strong security mindset. In addition to the artifacts in my ePortfolio, I have actively participated in discussions and assignments related to cybersecurity, understanding the importance of considering security at every stage of software development. I have incorporated security measures into various projects, such as implementing user authentication and encryption to safeguard data and resources.

**Overall Integration of Artifacts:**
         The artifacts in my ePortfolio collectively showcase the full range of my computer science talents and abilities. They provide evidence of my proficiency in collaborating with teams, effectively communicating technical concepts, applying data structures and algorithms, practicing software engineering principles, managing databases, and prioritizing security. Together, these artifacts paint a comprehensive picture of my readiness to enter the computer science field and contribute effectively to a variety of projects and roles.

The examples that follow comprise my Capstone Project for the program. In the following sections, I will provide specific examples and details related 
to the artifacts included in my ePortfolio, further illustrating how each artifact aligns with the skills and competencies discussed in this professional self-assessment.

## Code Review of Three Artifacts

To showcase my work in this portfolio I have chosen three items which we will call artifacts from various courses within the program.

The three categories in which I will demonstrate my skills are:

- **Software Design and Engineering**

- **Algorithms and Data Structures**

- **Databases**

The links below correspond to my code review. Each video contains an explanation of the artifact,
a code review, and the enhancements I propose for each artifact.
